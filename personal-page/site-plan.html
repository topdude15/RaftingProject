      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This website will be a place for video gamers to get information on all games, across any platform.  It will show users what games are coming up and recommend games that would be best for them based on their previously selected titles.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will be video game players that are looking for new games that they are able to play.  According to Statista, 70% of gamers are ove the age of 18, so I will be primarily catering to the adult audience, meaning that I will put less focus on games designed for children.</p>  <!-- change this -->
